## Items

This mod creates the following line-up of cooker items. The gameplay principle is to provide items that are either multi-use with fuel requirements or single-use without fuel requirements. The ability to cook with a campfire is moved to a distinct item.

### Mess Kit

A widely used army mess kit, consisting of a mess tin and basic metal cutlery. Can be used as a pan or small pot over an existing heat source (like a campfire) for basic dishes. It is highly compact and features a recognisable convex-concave bottom profile, concave on one side, supplied with a wire handle-loop for hanging and carrying, and is reasonably easy to clean and reuse. Sufficient to cook low quality meats that don't require high temperatures. Due to its manufacturing quality, it has limited durability.

### Disposable Gas Cooker

A single-use stove cooker with a pre-mounted propane tank. Slightly heavier than usual because of a crude frying pot combo attachment to make the cooker ready for use as-is. Popular in the Zone as an entry-level stove with an adjustable burner to cook meats and dishes that require a high temperature. Besides its questionable manufacturing quality, its use is limited by the small gas tank. Cheaply imported into the Zone in bulk via Chinese resellers.

### Portable Charcoal Cooker

A compact, foldable oven for cooking with charcoal or dry wood, made of stainless steel. The stove can produce temperatures sufficient to grill less contaminated meats and dishes. In the Zone, it is a popular upgrade to commonly sold disposable cookers, appreciated for its ability to use far cheaper imported charcoal over liquid fuels. Especially useful for deeper expeditions into the Zone where established campfires aren't available. Includes a complementary pan that perfectly fits on its frame.

### Portable Multi-Fuel Stove

A powerful, robust, and reliable stove designed for universal off-the-grid cooking needs. It features a finely adjustable burner, very high heat output and can be adapted to use virtually any kind of gas and liquid fuel. This model has surpassed all other portable stoves previously used for its resilience against the harsh conditions of the Zone. Includes a complementary set of durable cookware.
